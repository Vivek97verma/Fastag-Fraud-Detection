# Fastag-Fraud-Detection
I completed an advanced data analysis project focused on detecting fraudulent transactions within the FASTag electronic toll collection system.
Using a robust dataset with features such as date, time, FASTag ID, lane type, tollbooth ID, transaction amount, amount paid, and vehicle type, I applied data analysis techniques to identify anomalies and potential fraud.

Key achievements:

Developed and implemented algorithms to detect irregular patterns in transaction data, improving fraud detection efficiency.
⭐Analyzed the correlation between transaction attributes to flag suspicious activities.
⭐Enhanced the accuracy and reliability of the fraud detection system, contributing to safer and more secure toll operations.
⭐Utilized SQL, Python, and data visualization tools to streamline the analysis and reporting process.
⭐Achieved a fraud detection accuracy rate of 60% through rigorous testing and validation.
